## Subset Specifications

### CCI4.0-M2-Base v1
- **Purpose**: Core pretraining data for general language understanding
- **Data Composition**:
  - Chinese: 15% (Including data from cooperation projects and open-source projects)
  - English: 85% (primarily sourced from Nemotron-CC and various specific domains like math, code, books etc)
- **Total Volume**: 3000GB
- **Processing**:
  - Document-level and phrase-level deduplication
  - Rigorous quality filtering through the integration of three quality scores
  - Knowledge enhancement via LLM rewriting and generation
  - Filtering based on LLM Loss grouped by domain
  - PII and toxic filtering
- **License**:
  Due to the [license concern](#license-details), we split CCI4.0-M2-Base v1 into 2 datasets.
  1. CCI4.0-M2-Base-v1 
    - For open-source datasets, we selected those with an **Apache-2.0 license**.  
    - For datasets contributed by various institutions, we conducted **additional license verification**.  
    - **Nemotron-CC** is subject to the **Common Crawl License**, so we will only release its **metadata** along with our **processed scores**.  
  2. CCI4.0-M2-Extra-v1
    - For data that is open-source but requires independent licensing or involves mixed/composite licenses, we categorize it under this "Extra" dataset.

### CCI4.0-M2-CoT v1 
- **Purpose**: Chain-of-Thought reasoning enhancement
- **Total Volume**: 4200GB
- **Special Features**:
  - Step-by-step CoT trajactorys
  - Detailed question generation
  - Multiple domain coverage(e.g., math, code, webpages)
- **License**
  Based on the data from these sources, CoT synthesis and instruction synthesis of reverse thinking have been carried out. Due to license considerations, a separate directory will be created to open-source these data.

#### Introduction and Demonstration of Synthesized Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the CCI4.0-M2-CoT v1 subset is synthesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models. This synthesis process involves generating step-by-step reasoning trajectories based on various data sources

The following image illustrates the CoT synthesis pipeline:

This pipeline showcases how the raw data from different sources is processed and transformed into structured CoT data, which can be used for training language models to perform complex reasoning tasks.
